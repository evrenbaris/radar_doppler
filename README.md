# Doppler Effect Simulation: Target Motion and Tracking

This project simulates the Doppler effect to calculate the velocities of multiple moving targets and track their motion over time.

## Features
- Simulates Doppler frequency shifts for multiple targets.
- Combines reflected signals with Doppler effect.
- Visualizes target movements over time.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
